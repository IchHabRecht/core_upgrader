/**
 * This is a generic updater to migrate content of TCA rows.
 *
 * Multiple classes implementing interface "RowUpdateInterface" can be
 * registered here, each for a specific update purpose.
 *
 * The updater fetches each row of all TCA registered tables and
 * visits the client classes who may modify the row content.
 *
 * The updater remembers for each class if it run through, so the updater
 * will be shown again if a new updater class is registered that has not
 * been run yet.
 *
 * A start position pointer is stored in the registry that is updated during
 * the run process, so if for instance the PHP process runs into a timeout,
 * the job can restart at the position it stopped.
 * @internal This class is only meant to be used within EXT:install and is not part of the TYPO3 Core API.
